\subsection{Vehicle Trajectory [Andy McClaskey]}
The design of this vehicle was based on a 1500 pounds per square foot (71.82 kPa) constant dynamic pressure trajectory. The trajectory was found by iterating Mach number to make the density given in the dynamic pressure equation match that given by the standard atmosphere function. The altitude and velocity trajectory are shown in Figure \ref{fig:altVMach} and Figure \ref{fig:velVMach}. For the specified mission of launching at Mach 5.5 and accelerating to the cruise condition at Mach 6.5 with a constant dynamic pressure of 1500 psf, the vehicle velocity varies between 1625 m/s and 1940 m/s, while the altitude varies between 23.0 km and 25.3 km.

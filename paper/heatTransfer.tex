\subsubsection{Nozzle [Gabriel Diez]}

The data used to design the ablative cooling system on the nozzle was taken from Tick et al \cite{tick}. In the study N2O4 and hydrazine were burned at 830 kPa and exhausted out of a nozzle coated with a 12.5 mm thick layer of silica phenolic ablative. Several parameters were varied in the experiment but in each test the fluid temperature exiting the combustor was 3144 K which lead to surface temperatures on the nozzle of 2644 K. Under these conditions, the time to char through the ablative as well as the erosion rate were measured. The time to char through was above 200s and the erosion rate never exceeded 0.05 mm/s. Since the total burning time of the RDE scramjet is 120 s and the gas temperatures never exceed 2500 K, it can be estimated that no more than 6 mm of ablative will be burned off. Therefore a design with a 12.5 mm thick layer of silica phenolic ablative coating similar to the one used in the Tick et al (1965) study was chosen since it had been proven experimentally to function under harsher conditions for a longer period of time. The ablative coating covers a metal interior support made of titanium for even further protection against any conductive heat transfer. A cross section of the ablative layer is displayed in Figure ( ).
